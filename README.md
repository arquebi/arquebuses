# arquebuses

The arquebus `(/ˈɑːrk(w)ɪbəs/ AR-k(w)ib-əs)`, derived from the German Hakenbüchse, was a form of long gun that appeared in Europe during the 15th century.
Although the term arquebus was applied to many different forms of firearms from the 15th to 17th centuries, it originally referred to "a hand-gun with a hook-like projection or lug on its under surface, useful for steadying it against battlements or other objects when firing.
These "hook guns" were in their earliest forms defensive weapons mounted on German city walls in the early 1400s, but by the late 1400s had become handheld firearms.
The development of the arquebus is somewhat tied to technology developed for the crossbow as without the stock from the crossbow, the arquebus would not have a stable platform to rest one's shoulder on.
Priming pans also were placed on the arquebus.
A matchlock mechanism was added around 1475 and it became the first firearm with a trigger.
The heavy arquebus, known as the musket, was developed to better penetrate plate armor and appeared in Europe around 1521.
